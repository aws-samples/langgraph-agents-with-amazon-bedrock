    "# Lab 1: Building a ReAct Agent from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "## The ReAct Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll construct an AI agent using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern. If you're unfamiliar with this concept, don't worry—we'll break it down step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReAct pattern is a framework for structuring an AI's problem-solving process, mirroring human cognitive patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reason** about the current situation\n",
    "2. **Decide** on an action to take\n",
    "3. **Observe** the results of that action\n",
    "4. **Repeat** until the task is complete\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this concept, consider how an experienced software engineer might approach debugging a complex system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reason**: Analyze the error logs and system state (e.g., \"The database connection is timing out\")\n",
    "2. **Act**: Implement a diagnostic action (e.g., \"Run a database connection test\")\n",
    "3. **Observe**: Examine the results of the diagnostic (e.g., \"The test shows high latency\")\n",
    "4. **Repeat**: Continue this process, perhaps checking network configurations next, until the issue is resolved\n",
    "\n",
    "Our AI agent will employ a similar methodology to tackle problems. As we develop this agent, pay attention to the division of labor between the AI model (the \"brain\" that reasons and decides) and our Python code (the \"body\" that interacts with the environment and manages the process flow).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is based on the following [notebook from Simon Willison](https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/python-react-pattern).\n"

    "### Initializing the Bedrock Client\n",
    "\n",
    "To communicate with the Claude model via Amazon Bedrock, we need to establish a client connection. Think of this client as an API gateway that enables our code to send requests to the AI model and receive responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the `boto3` library, which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. For those unfamiliar with AWS, `boto3` can be thought of as a comprehensive toolkit that facilitates Python's interaction with various AWS services, including Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "For comprehensive instructions on configuring `boto3` with AWS credentials, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "The ReAct pattern, which our agent will implement, consists of three primary steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reasoning (Thought)**: The agent assesses the current situation and formulates a plan. For instance, \"To calculate the total weight of two dog breeds, I need to look up their individual weights and then sum them.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Acting (Action)**: Based on its reasoning, the agent selects an appropriate action. For example, \"I will query the average weight of a Border Collie.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Observing (Observation)**: The agent processes the feedback from its action. In our case, this might be \"The average weight of a Border Collie is 30-55 pounds.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern enables the agent to decompose complex tasks into manageable steps and adapt its strategy based on new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Agent class will implement this pattern by maintaining a conversation history (`self.messages`) and providing methods to interact with the Claude model (`__call__` and `execute`).\n"
